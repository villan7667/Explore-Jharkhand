        <h2>History of Jharkhand</h2>
        <p align="justify">Jharkhand, often called the "Land of Forests," is a region deeply rooted in tribal culture and ancient traditions. Established as a separate state in 2000, it boasts a rich heritage that is intertwined with its abundant natural resources. From its dense forests to mineral-rich landscapes, Jharkhand is a treasure trove of natural beauty and cultural wealth. The state is home to diverse indigenous tribes, each with unique customs, languages, and crafts. Jharkhand’s history is not only shaped by its people but also by its rich arts and heritage, making it a fascinating blend of tradition and prosperity. Jharkhand historical significance is also shaped by its role in India’s freedom struggle, with tribal leaders like Birsa Munda leading revolts against British colonial rule. Today, the state stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of its people and their deep connection with the land.</p>
